### Data Sources

The dataset used in this project is a simulated telecom customer dataset, including fields such as Customer ID, Contract Start and End Dates, Call IDs, Agent IDs, Average Talk Duration, and Call Resolution Status. It also contains key metrics like Customer Satisfaction Ratio, Speed of Answer, and derived fields such as Churn Status and Customer Risk Score. The data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, and further analysis was done with DAX in Power BI to provide insights into customer retention. All data is fictional and used solely for educational purposes.

### Tools Used

- Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- Power Query: For data cleaning and transformation.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For calculating key metrics and creating data models.
- Excel: For initial data exploration and preparation.
- GitHub: For version control and project documentation.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

The dataset was cleaned using Power Query to 
 
 1. Handle missing values,
 2. standardize data types, and remove duplicates.
 3. Create Key calculated columns such as Churn Status and Customer Risk Score, to provide more actionable insights.
 4. Correct Data inconsistencies, like date formats,
 5.  Aggregate and prepare for analysis using DAX in Power BI.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed customer churn rates to understand overall retention trends.
- Examined average call duration and its impact on customer satisfaction.
- Explored correlations between customer satisfaction ratios and resolution times.
- Identified high-risk customer segments prone to churn.
- Evaluated agent performance through call handling and resolution success rates.
- Visualized patterns in call answer speed and its effect on customer experience.
- Discovered potential areas for proactive customer retention efforts.

### Data Analysis

- Churn Rate Calculation: Measured the percentage of customers terminating their service over a given period.
- Retention Rate Calculation: Analyzed the percentage of customers who continued their service.
- Customer Segmentation: Grouped customers based on their risk of churn and analyzed retention patterns within each group.
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Calculated the estimated revenue generated by a customer over their lifetime.
- Agent Performance: Evaluated agents' efficiency based on average talk time, resolution rate, and number of calls handled.
- Speed of Answer: Assessed the impact of response times on customer satisfaction and retention.
- Satisfaction Analysis: Explored the relationship between call resolution and customer satisfaction ratings.

### Results/Findings

- High Churn Rate: Identified a significant percentage of customers terminating their contracts, highlighting the need for proactive retention strategies.
- At-Risk Customers: Segmentation analysis revealed that high-risk customers were more likely to churn within three months of experiencing unresolved service issues.
- Agent Performance Variance: Found substantial differences in agent performance, with top-performing agents handling more calls and achieving higher satisfaction scores.
- Impact of Speed of Answer: Faster call response times were strongly correlated with higher customer satisfaction and lower churn rates.
- Customer Satisfaction Influence: Customers with unresolved issues showed a dramatic drop in satisfaction scores, increasing the likelihood of churn.
- Retention Insights: Customers with consistent, positive interactions over time had a much higher retention rate and CLV.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis i made, i would recommend
- Implement Predictive Churn Models: Use predictive analytics to identify at-risk customers earlier and intervene before churn occurs.
- Proactive Customer Engagement: Engage with high-risk customers through personalized offers and support to improve retention rates.
- Enhance Agent Training: Focus on training agents to improve resolution rates and reduce average talk time, leading to better customer satisfaction.
- Improve Speed of Answer: Allocate resources to reduce wait times during peak hours, as faster responses lead to higher satisfaction.
- Feedback Loop Integration: Continuously collect and analyze customer feedback to address pain points and improve service quality.
- Regular Dashboard Updates: Keep the retention dashboard updated with real-time data for ongoing monitoring and decision-making.

### Limitations

The project faced several limitations including incomplete data, such as missing demographic details and qualitative feedback, which restricted the depth of the analysis. The dataset is static and limited to a short time frame, impacting the ability to address real-time trends and long-term customer behavior. Additionally, data quality issues with missing or inconsistent points may affect the accuracy of insights. The analysis relies solely on customer service data, excluding other relevant sources like marketing and billing.
